# Graph-NIDS: Detecting Network Intrusions via HGT-based Edge Classification on Network Traffic Graphs

<div align="center">
</div>

This repository contains the official implementation for **Graph-NIDS**, a novel Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). This project leverages the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically the **Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)**, to perform edge classification on network traffic graphs, effectively identifying malicious activities.

---

## üìú Overview
The core objective of this research is to re-frame the network intrusion detection problem from a graph-based perspective. By modeling network traffic data from the **UNSW-NB15** dataset as a large, heterogeneous graph, we can effectively capture the complex relationships between IP addresses, ports, and protocols. An **HGT model** is then trained to perform edge classification, discerning whether a given network flow (an edge between two IP address nodes) is **benign ('Normal')** or an **'Intrusion'**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
The end-to-end workflow of the system, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is illustrated below:

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: Builds a rich graph structure with multiple node types (`ip`, `port`, `proto`) and edge types to represent diverse network interactions.
- **Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)**: Employs the state-of-the-art HGT architecture designed for handling complex, heterogeneous graphs.
- **Edge Classification Task**: Frames intrusion detection as an edge classification problem, classifying network flows between `ip` nodes as 'Normal' or 'Intrusion'.
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Includes robust scripts for sampling, stratification, and preprocessing of the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

---

## üî¨ Methodology
### 1. Preprocessing
- Raw network flow records from UNSW-NB15 undergo rigorous preprocessing.
- Categorical features (`proto`, `service`, `state`) are encoded.
- Numerical features are normalized using `StandardScaler`, fitted only on training data to avoid leakage.

### 2. Graph Construction
- **Node Types**: `ip`, `port`, `proto`
- **Edge Types**:
  - (`ip`, `flows_to`, `ip`)
  - (`ip`, `uses_port`, `port`)
  - (`port`, `uses_proto`, `proto`)
  - Plus inverses to enable bidirectional message passing

- Features are assigned to the (`ip`, `flows_to`, `ip`) edges ‚Äî these are the classification targets.

### 3. HGT Model Training
- Trained for **10 epochs**.
- Classifies the (`ip`, `flows_to`, `ip`) edges by aggregating and propagating information across different node and edge types.
- Performance monitored on the validation set each epoch.

### 4. Evaluation
- A statistically optimal probability threshold (**0.4724**) is selected to maximize the F1-score for the minority class.
- Evaluation performed on unseen test graph.

Implementation details can be found in `HGT_Training_Code.ipynb`.
